# No No Solo

Made for the [Newgrounds HaxeFlixel Game Jam](https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1450269) with the theme "Alone, Together".

The game idea wasn't that interesting so I gave up on it early before exploring what levels I could make with it.

It's not very optimised and there are bugs if moving objects move at the same time on ice.

There are 11 levels.

## Controls
* arrows - move
* space - swap
* backspace - undo
* r - reset
* end - skip level
